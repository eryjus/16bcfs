Please understand that I do not represent or warranty that these schematics and PCB designs are fit for any purpose including the project for which they were intended.  I would hate for you to invest your own hard-earned money into something that may or may not work for you.  However, you are free to do what you wish with this stuff as stated in the [license](../LICENSE.md).  Just have fun with it.
