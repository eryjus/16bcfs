# 16-Bit Computer From Scratch -- Test Code

This is the source code that supports my *16-Bit Computer From Scratch* project.  This project in particular contains all the source code I use to test parts of the computer as it is being built.

## EEPROM Programmer

I do not have a commercial EEPROM programmer.  I use the TommyPROM programmer.  You can find all the relevant information on TommyPROM [here](https://tomnisbet.github.io/TommyPROM/).  In Linux, I use `minicom` as the interface.  Hint: use `sudo minicom -s` to set up the defaults.
